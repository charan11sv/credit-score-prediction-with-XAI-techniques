# credit-score-prediction-with-XAI-techniques
to eventually test these techniques-----gradient boosting models, Neural networks,Neural Monotonic Additive Models (NMAMs) AND  explore explainable AI (XAI) techniques for credit scoring..like SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations), LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), and Transparent Neural Networks
